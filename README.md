# Lead Scorer


## Description
The aim is to create a model that provides a score for the leads generated in the digital ecosystem of the countries where the company operates.


## Considerations
  - This score would ideally be used to optimize both the acquisition campaigns and the management of the opportunity from the creation of the lead.
  - The variables will contain traffic source and device, and key web event counters, without any personal information.
